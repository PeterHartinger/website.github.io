            <p>Our client (Professor) wanted a digital version of his flight logbook. To make this happen, we got together as a team of five. At the start of the project, we had a chat with our customer to find out what he was looking for. Based on this info, we put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Pflichtenheft_NoNames.pdf" download>specification sheet</a>. At the same time, we put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Lastenheft_NoNames.pdf" download>requirement sheet</a>. We did this because our professor wanted us to get to grips with both types.</p>
            
            <p>Once the customer had looked over and made some changes to our documents, we carried on. We put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Traceability_NoNames.pdf" download>traceability document</a>. Once we'd got the basics down, we put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Software Konfiguration Management Plan_NoNames.pdf" download>software configuration management plan</a>. We were ready to get started with the coding. We went with a model-view-controller concept.</p>
            
            <p>Once we'd finished building the <a href="https://github.com/PeterHartinger/AirLogix" target="_blank">app</a>, the only thing left to do was to test it. So we put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Testplan_NoNames.pdf" download>test plan</a>. Once we'd run the tests and analysed the results, we were able to put together a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Testbericht_NoNames.pdf" download>test report</a>. The last thing we did was create a <a href="FlugLogBuchNoNames/Release_NoNames.pdf" download>release note</a>. We only made one version of this, as we'd already finished the project as part of our studies and there was no point in continuing it.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, we gave our customer a presentation of our product.</p>
